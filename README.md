xbmc-parental-controls
======================

Xbox Media Center parental controls plugin

Select the video plugins you want to protect and the ratings you want to allow.  
Supports both TV and Movie ratings.  This plugin will ask for an unlock code 
before granting access to any content you have blocked.  It works best with 
video plugins that supply an MPAA rating such as the bluecop hulu plugin.  Video 
plugins which don't supply an MPAA rating will require an unlock code to view any 
content.  Entering the unlock code will unlock the parental controls for 5 minutes.

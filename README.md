Xbox Media Center parental controls addon
==========================================

Select the video addons you want to protect and the ratings you want to allow.  
Supports both TV and Movie ratings.  This addon will ask for an unlock code 
before granting access to any content you have blocked.  It works best with 
video addons that supply an MPAA rating such as the bluecop hulu addon.  Video 
addons which don't supply an MPAA rating will require an unlock code to view any 
content.  Entering the code will unlock the parental controls for 5 minutes.  

INSTALLATION
============
Download the zip file from 

https://github.com/killdash9/xbmc-parental-controls/downloads

and place it in a location you can browse to from Xbox Media Center.  In XBMC, go
to System -> Settings -> Addons -> Install from zip file.  Browse to the zip file
you downloaded and install it.

USING IT
========
In XBMC, go to Programs -> Parental Controls.  The first time you will need to 
choose a code.  Once you are in, you can select the video addons you wish to
protect and the ratings you will allow.  At that point, you can browse your video
addons and it will block restricted content.  Restricted content will be placed 
under a sub-menu that you need to enter your code to access.
